# Lab Experiments

1. Print in console all the class fields accessible to the class
   object.
2. Print in console all the functions accessible to the class object.
3. Print in console all the classes and the amount of heap space to be 
   allocated while instantiating an object of that class. Take care of
   inheritance also.
4. Compare the output of the generated microIR program (use the interpreter)
   with the output of the MiniJava program generated by the javac compiler.
